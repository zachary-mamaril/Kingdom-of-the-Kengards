# Motivation

Board and down on my luck in the California Central Valley, my fellow pharmacy technician and I played deck building games to keep our sanity. This sparked an idea to create a large, medieval styled, deck builder that would further take the deck building gameplay.

# Rules

- Start with 3 peasant cards and 2 household guard cards.
- Players start with 50 health.
- 3 Phases per round 1st. Purchase 2nd. Deploy/Attack/Defend 3rd. Politics
- At the end of each round, your peasants give you gold. Each round, the caravan changes and the center trade-market shuffles and plays new cards.
- Card types: Attack/Defend , Income , Castle, Land , Politics(trade agreements, pacts, subterfuge).


# Current Card Frames:
I've yet to decide on which frame, but here are some prototypes.

# Current Card Art:
It's a slow process but some art for some cards have been created. These will fill the windows of the card frame.
